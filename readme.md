# Recruiting telemetry

> ⚠️ This document is fairly technical to maintain brevity, if you have **any** questions ask your recruiter or come visit us at floor -2 of Povo 2.

## Abstract

From the project you chose, we will test your programming skills in C/C++, your approach to a problem and your solving process.  
Remember that the choices you make must have a foundation, and based on that an easier solution may be preferred to a more complex one.  
Choose only one of theese two project, depending on what you're more interested in. 

## Projects

Here you can find two folders:

- [project_1](./project_1/readme.md): Made for the ones who applied for the UI part of our telemetry software.
- [project_2](./project_2/readme.md): If you applied for the low level part of the telemetry, this project is for you.
